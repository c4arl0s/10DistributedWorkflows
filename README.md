# 10. [Distributed workflows - Intro]()

Now that we know how to share information via a centralized workflow, we can appreciate some of the drawbacks of this collaboration model. While it may be convenient, allowing everyone to push to an **"official"** repository raises some legitimate security concerns. It means that for everyone to contribute content, they need access to the **entire project**.

This is fine if you re only interacting with a small team, but imagine a scenario where you are working on an open-source software project and a stranger found a bug, fixed it, and wants to incorporate the update into the main project. You probably don't want to give them push-access to your central repository, since they could start pushing all sorts of random snapshots, and you would effectively lose control of the project.

But, what you can do is tell the contributor to push the changes to **their own** public repository. Then you can pull their bug fix into your private repository to ensure it does not contain any undeclared code. If you approve their contributions, all you have to do is merge them into a local branch and push it to the main repository, just like we did in the previous model. You have become an **integrator**, in addition to an ordinary developer.

In this module, we will experience all of this first-hand by creating a free public repository on Bit-bucket.org and incorporating a contribution from an anonymous developer named John. Bitbucket is a DVCS hosting provider that makes it very easy to set up a Git repository and start collaborating with a team of developers.

# 	* [Create a Bitbucket Account]()

You can choose any username for your account, but the email address should match the one you assigned to your git installation with **git config** in [The basics](). If you need to change your email, you can run another **git config --global user.mail yoy@example.com** command.

```console
Thu Jun 18 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository/.git 
$ git config --global user.email c.santiago.cruz@icloud.com
```

# 	* [Create a Public Repository (you)]()

To create our first nerworked Git repository, log into your Bitbucket account, and navigate to **Repositories - Create repository**. 

![Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 10 21 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85039654-90504800-b14d-11ea-8cbd-cdfc61d51c02.png)

Use my git repository as the **RepositoryName**, and anything you like for the **description** field. Since this is just an example project, go ahead and uncheck the **This is a private repository** field. Select HTML/CSS for the **Language field**, then go ahead and click **Create repository**.

Essentially, we just ran **git init --bare** on a Bitbucket server. We can now push to and fetch from this repository as we did with **central-repo.git** in the previous module.

After initialization, Bitbucket offers some helpful instructions, but don't follow them just yet - we will through importing an existing repository in the next section,

![Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 10 29 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85040678-aa3e5a80-b14e-11ea-8c4e-e5d5f691a99a.png)

# 	* [Push to a Public Repository (you)]()

Before populating this new repository with our existing my git repository project, we firs need to point our **origin remote** to the Bitbucket repository. Be sure to change the userName portion to your actual Bitbucket userName.

```console
Thu Jun 18 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorial_Carlos 
$ cd ../RysGitTutorialRepository/
```

```console
Thu Jun 18 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ git remote rm origin
```

```console
Thu Jun 18 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ git remote add origin https://C4rl0sS4nt14g0@bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository.git
```

The utility of remotes should be more apparent than in previous modules, as typing the full path to this repository every time we needed to interact with it would be rather tedious.

To populate the remote repository with our existing code, we can use the same push mechanism as with a centralized workflow. When prompted for a password, use the one that you signed up with.

```console
Thu Jun 18 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository/.git 
$ git push origin master
To https://bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://C4rl0sS4nt14g0@bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

As you can see, and if you remember the creation a README file, the origin and the local is not the same, to overwrite what you have in you local repository pass the -f flag to pussh to force the push command.

```console
Thu Jun 18 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository/.git 
$ git push -f origin master

Counting objects: 100% (84/84), done.

To https://bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository.git
 + bfa132d...450182a master -> master (forced update)
```

# 	* [Browse the Public Repository (you)]()

We should now be able to see our project on the bitBucket site. The **Source** tab displays all of the files in the project, and the **commits** tab contains the entire commit history. Note that the branch structure of the repository is also visualized to the left of each commit.

![Screen Shot 2020-06-18 at 11 18 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85046031-74e93b00-b155-11ea-81ed-83a45126a70a.png)

This repository now serves as the **"official"** copy our example website. We will tell everyone else to download from this repository, and we will push all the changes from our local my-git-repository to it. However, It is important to note that this **"official"** status is merely a convention. As the **master branch** is just another branch, our Bitbucket repository is just another repository according to Git.

Having both a public and a private repository for each developer makes it easy to incorporate contributions from third-parties, even if you have never met them before.

# 	* [Clone the Repository (John]()

Next we are going to pretend to be John, a third-party contributor to our website. John noticed that we didn't have a pink page and, being the friendly developer that he is, wants to create one for us. We would like to let him contribute, but **we don't want to give him push-access** to our entire repository - this would allow him to re-write or even delete all of our hard word.

Fortunately, John knows how to exploit Bitbucket's collaboration potential. He will start by cloning a copy of our public repository:

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ cd ../RysGitTutorialRepository/
```

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ cd ../
```

I am going to follow the same pattern name used for all contributors, like RysGitTutorialMarysRepository and RysGitTutorialRepository, giving the name RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS 
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository.git RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository
Cloning into 'RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository'...
remote: Counting objects: 84, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (81/81), done.
remote: Total 84 (delta 37), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (84/84), 10.08 KiB | 43.00 KiB/s, done.
```

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS 
$ cd RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository/
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ 
```

You should now have another copy of our repository called RysGitTutorialJohnsRepositor in the same folder as RysGitTutorialRepository. This is John's private  repository - a completely isolated environment where he can safely develop the pink page. Let's quickly configure his name and email

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git config user.name "John"
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git config user.email john.developer@icloud.com
```
 
# 	* [Add the Pink Page (John)]()

Of course, John should be developing his contributions in a dedicated feature branch.

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git checkout -b pink-page
Switched to a new branch 'pink-page'
```

In addition to being a best practice, this makes it easy for the integrator to see what commits to include. When John's done, he will tell us where to find his repository and what branch the new features resides in. Then, we will be able merge his content with minimal effort.

Create the file pink.html and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>The Pink Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #F0F">The Pink Page</h1>
  <p>Pink is <span style="color: #F0F">girly,
  flirty and fun</span>!</p>

  <p><a href="index.html">Return to home page</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```

Add the pink page to the "Navigation" section in index.html

```html
<li style="color: #F0F">
  <a href="pink.html">The Pink Page</a>
</li>
```

Then, stage and commit the snapshot as normal.

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git add pink.html index.html 
```

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git status
On branch pink-page
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   index.html
	new file:   pink.html
```

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git commit -m "Add pink page"
[pink-page 51f9d9e] Add pink page
 2 files changed, 18 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 pink.html
```

# 	* [Publish the Pink Page (John)]()

Now, John needs to publish this contributions to a public repository. Remember that we don't want him to push or **our** public repository, which is stored in his **origin remote**, which is stored in his **origin remote**. In fact, **he can't push** to origin for reasons we will discuss in a moment.

Instead, he will create his own Bitbucket repository that we can pull contributions from. In the real world, John would have his own Bitbucket account, but for convenience, we will just store his public repository under our existing account. 

Once again, navigate to your Bitbucket home page and click Repositories then Create Repository to create Johns public repository. For the **Name** field, use RysGitTutorialJohnsRepositor 

![Screen Shot 2020-06-19 at 16 34 55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85181183-e656e580-b24a-11ea-9468-0887dd082ffc.png)

Back in John's private repository, we will need to add this as a remote. Remember to copy the link that Bitbucket provides you, and name it john-public

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git remote add john-public https://C4rl0sS4nt14g0@bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialjohnsrepositor.git
```

This is where John will publish the pink page for us to access. Since he is pushing with HTTPS, he will need to enter the password for his bitbucket account (which is actually the password for your account).

```console
Fri Jun 19 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git push john-public pink-page
Enumerating objects: 88, done.
Counting objects: 100% (88/88), done.

remote: 
To https://bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialjohnsrepositor.git
 * [new branch]      pink-page -> pink-page
```

![Screen Shot 2020-06-19 at 16 47 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85181842-96791e00-b24c-11ea-905f-d540bec06580.png)

All John needs to do now is tell us the name of the feature branch and send us a link to his repository, which will be:

```html
https://C4rl0sS4nt14g0@bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialjohnsrepositor.git
```

Note that John used a different path for pushing to his public repository than the one he gave us for fetching from it. The most important distinction is the transport protocol: the former used https:// while the latter used http://. Accessing a repository over HTTPS (or SSH) lets you fetch or push, but as we saw, requires a password. This prevents unknown developers from overwriting commits.

On the other hand, fetching over HTTP requires no username or password, but pushing is not possible. This lets anyone fetch from a repository without compromising its security, In the integrator workflow, other developers access your repository via HTTP, while you publish changes via HTTPS. This is also the reason why John can't push to his origin remote.

Of course, if you are working on a private project, anonymous HTTP access would be disable for that repository.

# 	* [View John's Contributions (you)]()

Ok, we are done being John and we are ready to integrate his code into the official project. Let's start by switching back into our repository and adding John's public repository as a remote.

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ cd ../RysGitTutorialRepository/
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ git remote add john https://C4rl0sS4nt14g0@bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialjohnsrepositor.git
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ git fetch john

 * [new branch]      master     -> john/master
 * [new branch]      pink-page  -> john/pink-page
```

```console
$ git branch -r
  john/master
  john/pink-page
  origin/master
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ git log master..john/pink-page --stat

    Add pink page

 index.html |  3 +++
 pink.html  | 15 +++++++++++++++
 2 files changed, 18 insertions(+)
```

You can visualize this history information as the following:

![Screen Shot 2020-06-20 at 16 49 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85212191-f8518a80-b315-11ea-9bdd-9600c565fbe7.png)

Let's take a look at his actual changes:

```console
git checkout john/pink-page
Note: switching to 'john/pink-page'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 51f9d9e Add pink page
```

Open up the pink.html file to see if it is ok, remember that John is not a trusted collaborator, and we would normally have no idea what this file might contain. With that in mind, It is incredibly important to verify its contents. **Never blindly merge content from a third-party contributor.

# 	* [Integrate John's Contributions (you)]()

Assuming we approve John's updates, we are now ready to merge it into the project.

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
git checkout master
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ git merge john/pink-page
Updating 450182a..51f9d9e
Fast-forward
 index.html |  3 +++
 pink.html  | 15 +++++++++++++++
 2 files changed, 18 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 pink.html
```

Notice that is the exact same way we incorporated Mary's changes in the centralized workflow, except now we are pulling from and pushing to different locations.

![Screen Shot 2020-06-20 at 18 43 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85213586-fdb6d100-b325-11ea-9778-1b2f0d9bdaf1.png)

Furthermore, John's workflow is just like ours: develop in a local, private repository, then push changes to the public one. The integrator workflow is merely a standardized way of organizing the collaboration effort - nothing has changed about how we develop locally, and we are using the same Git commands as we have been for the las few modules.

# 	* [Publish John's Contributions (you)]()

We have integrated John's contribution into our local git repository, but no one else knows what we have done, It is time to publish our master branch again.

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ git push origin master
Enumerating objects: 6, done.
Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 611 bytes | 305.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository.git
   450182a..51f9d9e  master -> master
```

![Screen Shot 2020-06-20 at 18 54 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85213704-8d10b400-b327-11ea-999d-647f7c9f1a50.png)

Since we designated our public Bitbucket repository as the "official" source for our project, everyone (Mary and John) will now be able to synchronize with it.


# 	* [Update Mary's Repository (Mary)]()

Mary should now be pulling changes from our Bitbucket repository instead of the central one from the previous module. This should be fairly easy to her to configure.

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialRepository 
$ cd ../RysGitTutorialMarysRepository/
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialMarysRepository 
$
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialMarysRepository 
$ git remote rm origin
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialMarysRepository 
$ git remote add origin https://C4rl0sS4nt14g0@bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository.git
```

Again, remember to change userName to your bitbucket account's name. For the sake brevity. we will do a blind merge to add John's updates to Mary's repository (normally, Mary should check what she is integrating before doing so).

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialMarysRepository 
$ git checkout master
Already on 'master'
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialMarysRepository 
$ git fetch origin 
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), 591 bytes | 7.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository
 * [new branch]      master     -> origin/master
```

```console
$ git rebase origin/master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Add CSS styles for headings and links
```

For Mary, it does not really matter that the updates came from John. All she has to know is that the "Official" master branch moved forward, prompting her to synchronize her private repository.

# 	* [Update John's Repository (John)]()

John still needs to incorporate the pink page into **his master** branch. He should **not** merge directly from his pink-page topic branch because we could have edited his contribution before publishing it or included other contributions along with it. Instead, **he will pull from the "official" master**:

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialMarysRepository 
$ cd ../RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository/
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git fetch origin
From https://bitbucket.org/C4rl0sS4nt14g0/rysgittutorialrepository
   450182a..51f9d9e  master     -> origin/master
```

```console
$ git branch -r
  john-public/pink-page
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/master
```

```console
Sat Jun 20 ~/iOS/RysGitTutorialJohnsRepository 
$ git rebase origin/master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Fast-forwarded master to origin/master.
```

If John had updated **master** directly from his local pink-page, it could have wound up out-of-sync from the main project. For this reason, the integrator workflow requires that everyone **pull** from a single, official repository, while they all **push** to their own public repositories.

![Screen Shot 2020-06-20 at 19 23 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24994818/85214018-97cd4800-b32b-11ea-91b8-35491a0ab6e6.png)

# 	* [Conclusion]()

Using the integrator workflow, our private development process largely remains the same **(Develop a feature branch, merge it into master, and publish it)**. But, we have addedan additional task: incorporating changes from third-party contributors. Luckily, this does not required any new skills - just access to a few more remotes repositories.

While this setup forces us to keep track of more remotes, it also makes it much, much easier to work with a large number of developers. You will never have to worry about security using an integrator workflow because you will still be the only one with access to the **"official"i** repository.

There is also an interesting side-effect to this kind of security. By giving each developer their own public repository, the navigator workflow creates a more stable development environment for open source software projects. Should the lead developer **stop maintaining the "official" repository**, **any of the other participants could take over by simply designating their public repository as the new "official" project**. This is part of what makes Git **distributed** version control system: **There is no single central repository that Git forces everyone to rely upon.
